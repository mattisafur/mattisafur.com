        <h1>EKS easy-deploy Terraform module</h1>
        <p>
          Years ago, when I was creating an EKS cluster for the first time, I
          noticed that some of the configuration thee is hard to grasp as a
          beginner, And while this is a great place to learn I know that many
          junior devops engineers may not have the time to learn the ins and
          outs of the EKS, for example when faced with deadlines at work. It is
          for these scenarios that I have created this terraform module.
        </p>
        <p>
          This module deploy all the necessary resources needed to get an EKS
          cluster up and running (and the cluster itself of course). I have
          designed the module to be highly customizable but still easu to use
          with many default values and variable validations with helpful error
          messages.
